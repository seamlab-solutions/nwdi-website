                        For most women, age best predicts the chance of conception each month. However, despite having regular menstrual cycles and normal periods, many women lose their fertility sooner than expected. There are several tests which help predict whether a woman may have a faster biological clock, such as anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) test. This blood test helps to estimate what is called "ovarian reserve" by measuring the number of follicles developing in the ovary at a particular time.
