							<b><u>STREPTOCOCCAL INFECTIONS:</u></b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Strep is short for Streptococcus, a type of bacteria. There are two types: group A and group B.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					<b><i>Group A strep causes: </i></b>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Strep throat - a sore, red throat. Your tonsils may be swollen and have white spots on them.
					</li>
					<li>
						Scarlet fever - an illness that follows strep throat. It causes a red rash on the body.
					</li>
					<li>
						Impetigo - a skin infection
					</li>
					<li>
						Toxic shock syndrome
					</li>
					<li>
						Cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease)
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					<b><i>Group B strep causes: </i></b>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Blood infections, 
					</li>
					<li>
						pneumonia and 
					</li>
					<li>
						Meningitis in newborns.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					A screening test during pregnancy can tell if you have it. If you do, I.V. antibiotics during labor can save your baby's life. Adults can also get group B strep infections, especially if they are elderly or already have health problems. Strep B can cause urinary tract infections, blood infections, skin infections and pneumonia in adults. Antibiotics are used to treat strep infections.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b><i>Group B strep causes: </i></b>
				</p>
					<li>
						ASO: Antistreptolysin O titer - To help determine whether the patient  have had a recent strep infection with the bacteria group A Streptococcus; to help diagnose complications resulting from a strep infection such as rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis, a form of kidney disease.
					</li>
					
					</br>
					<li>
						Strep Test: Throat Culture - A throat culture or strep test is performed by using a throat swab to detect the presence of group A streptococcus bacteria, the most common cause of strep throat. These bacteria also can cause other infections, including scarlet fever, abscesses, and pneumonia.
					</li>
					</br>
				<p>
					A sample swabbed from the back of the throat is put on a special plate (culture) that enables bacteria to grow in the lab. The specific type of infection is determined using chemical tests. If bacteria don't grow, the culture is negative and the person doesn't have a strep throat infection.

						<b><u>THYROID DISEASES:</u></b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, just above your collarbone. It is one of your endocrine glands, which make hormones. Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. These include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. All of these activities are your body's metabolism.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					<b><i>Thyroid problems include:</i></b>
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>
						Goiter - enlargement of the thyroid gland 
					</li>
					<li>
						Hyperthyroidism - when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs
					</li>
					<li>
						Hypothyroidism - when your thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormones
					</li>
					<li>
						Thyroid cancer
					</li>
					<li>
						Thyroid nodules - lumps in the thyroid gland
					</li>
					<li>
						Thyroiditis - swelling of the thyroid
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					To diagnose thyroid diseases, doctors use a medical history, physical exam, and thyroid tests. They sometimes also use a biopsy. Treatment depends on the problem, but may include medicines, radioiodine therapy, or thyroid surgery.
				</p>
				<p>
					Health care professionals use thyroid tests to check how well your thyroid is working and to find the cause of problems such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid hormones control how the body uses energy, so they affect nearly every organ in your body, even your heart.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your doctor will start with blood tests and may also order imaging tests.

				<p class="ml-3">
					Doctors may order one or more blood tests to check your thyroid function. Tests may include thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), T4, T3, and thyroid antibody tests.
				</br>
					For these tests, a health care professional will draw blood from your arm and send it to a lab for testing. Your doctor will talk to you about your test results.
				</p>
				
				<p class="mb-0">
					<b>1. TSH test</b>
				</p>
				
				<p class="ml-3">
					Health care professionals usually check the amount of TSH in your blood first. TSH is a hormone made in the pituitary gland that tells the thyroid how much T4 and T3 to make.   
				</br>
				
					A high TSH level most often means you have hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid. This means that your thyroid isn’t making enough hormones. As a result, the pituitary keeps making and releasing TSH into your blood.
				</br>
				
					A low TSH level usually means you have hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid. This means that your thyroid is making too much hormone, so the pituitary stops making and releasing TSH into your blood. 
				
				</br>
					If the TSH test results are not normal, you will need at least one other test to help find the cause of the problem.
				</p>
				
				
				<p class="mb-0">
					<b>2. T4 tests</b>
				</p>
				<p class="ml-3">
					A high blood level of T4 may mean you have hyperthyroidism. A low level of T4 may mean you have hypothyroidism.
				</br>
					In some cases, high or low T4 levels may not mean you have thyroid problems. If you are pregnant or are taking oral contraceptives , your thyroid hormone levels will be higher. Severe illness or using corticosteroids—medicines to treat asthma, arthritis, skin conditions, and other health problems—can lower T4 levels. These conditions and medicines change the amount of proteins in your blood that “bind,” or attach, to T4. Bound T4 is kept in reserve in the blood until it’s needed. “Free” T4 is not bound to these proteins and is available to enter body tissues. Because changes in binding protein levels don’t affect free T4 levels, many healthcare professionals prefer to measure free T4.
				</p>
				
				<p class="mb-0">
					<b>3. T3 test</b>
				</p>
				<p class="ml-3">
					If your health care professional thinks you may have hyperthyroidism even though your T4 level is normal, you may have a T3 test to confirm the diagnosis. Sometimes T4 is normal yet T3 is high, so measuring both T4 and T3 levels can be useful in diagnosing hyperthyroidism.
				</p>
				
				<p class="mb-0">
					<b>4.Thyroid antibody tests</b>
				</p>
				<p class="ml-3">
					Measuring levels of thyroid antibodies may help diagnose an autoimmune thyroid disorder such as Graves’ disease—the most common cause of hyperthyroidism—and Hashimoto’s disease—the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Thyroid antibodies are made when your immune system attacks the thyroid gland by mistake. Your health care professional may order thyroid antibody tests if the results of other blood tests suggest thyroid disease.
				</p>
				<p class="ml-3">
					A high blood level of T4 may mean you have hyperthyroidism. A low level of T4 may mean you have hypothyroidism.
				</p>
				
				<h6>
					What imaging tests do doctors use to diagnose and find the cause of thyroid disease?
				</h6>
				<p class="ml-3">
					Your health care professional may order one or more imaging tests to diagnose and find the cause of thyroid disease. A trained technician usually does these tests in your doctor’s office, outpatient center, or hospital. A radiologist, a doctor who specializes in medical imaging, reviews the images and sends a report for your health care professional to discuss with you.
				</p>
				
				<p class="mb-0">
					<b>1. Ultrasound of the Thyroid </b>
				</p>
				<p class="ml-3">
					Ultrasound can help your doctor tell if the nodules are more likely to be cancerous. 
					</br>
					For an ultrasound, you will lie on an exam table and a technician will run a device called a transducer over your neck. The transducer bounces safe, painless sound waves off your neck to make pictures of your thyroid. The ultrasound usually takes around 30 minutes.
				</p>
				
				<p class="mb-0">
					<b>2. Thyroid scan</b>
				</p>
				<p class="ml-3">
					Health care professionals use a thyroid scan to look at the size, shape, and position of the thyroid gland. This test uses a small amount of radioactive iodine to help find the cause of hyperthyroidism and check for thyroid nodules.
					</br>
					Your health care professional may ask you to avoid foods high in iodine, such as kelp, or medicines containing iodine for a week before the test.
					</br>
					For the scan, a technician injects a small amount of radioactive iodine or a similar substance into your vein. You also may swallow the substance in liquid or capsule form. The scan takes place 30 minutes after an injection, or up to 24 hours after you swallow the substance, so your thyroid has enough time to absorb it.
					</br>
					During the scan, you will lie on an exam table while a special camera takes pictures of your thyroid. The scan usually takes 30 minutes or less.
					</br>
					Thyroid nodules that make too much thyroid hormone show up clearly in the pictures. Radioactive iodine that shows up over the whole thyroid could mean you have Graves’ disease.
					</br>
					Even though only a small amount of radiation is needed for a thyroid scan and it is thought to be safe, you should not have this test if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

						<b><u>STROKE</u></b>
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<p class="ml-3 mt-0">
					<b><i>What is Stroke ?</i></b>
					</br>
					A stroke happens when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted as a result of a ruptured or blocked blood vessel. Brain cells that do not receive a constant supply of oxygenated blood may die, causing permanent damage to the brain.
					</br>
					There are two types of strokes: hemorrhagic and ischemic.
					</br>
					A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures or breaks, allowing blood to leak into the brain.
					</br>
					An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel carrying blood to the brain is blocked or restricted by severely narrowed arteries or a thickened mass of blood called a blood clot.
					</br>
				</p>
				
				<ul class="ml-2">
					<li>
						Clogged arteries: Fat, cholesterol and other substances can collect on the walls of blood vessels. Over time, these substances harden and form structures called plaque. The build-up of fat deposits and plaque clog arteries, narrowing the passageway for blood.
					</li>
					<li>
						Blood clots: When a clot forms in a cerebral blood vessel that is already very narrow, it is called a thrombotic stroke. When a blood clot that has formed elsewhere in the body breaks away and travels to a blood vessel in the brain, the result is an embolic stroke, or cerebral embolism. An embolic stroke may also result from an air bubble or other foreign substance in the blood that moves into and blocks a cerebral blood vessel.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="ml-3">
					A short episode of stroke-like symptoms is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. Most often, no permanent damage results from a TIA; however, a TIA is often a warning sign that a stroke will occur. Symptoms of a TIA may last from a few minutes to up to 24 hours.
					</br>
					The symptoms of stroke depend on which part of the brain is affected. In some cases, a person may not know that he or she has had a stroke. Symptoms, which usually develop suddenly and without warning, include:
				</p>
				
				<ul class="ml-2">
					<li>
						severe headache with no known cause
					</li>
					<li>
						numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)
					</li>
					<li>
						confusion and trouble speaking or understanding speech
					</li>
					<li>
						trouble seeing in one or both eyes
					</li>
					<li>
						dizziness, loss of balance or coordination.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					<b><i>How is a stroke diagnosed and evaluated?</i></b>
				</p>
				
				<p class="ml-3 mt-0">
					The first step in assessing a stroke patient is to determine whether the patient is experiencing an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke so that the correct treatment can begin. A CT scan or MRI of the head is typically the first test performed.
				</p>
				
				<ul class="ml-2">
					<li>
						Computed tomography (CT) of the head: CT scanning combines special x-ray equipment with sophisticated computers to produce multiple images or pictures of the inside of the body. Physicians use CT of the head to detect a stroke from a blood clot or bleeding within the brain. To improve the detection and characterization of stroke, CT angiography (CTA) may be performed. In CTA, a contrast material may be injected intravenously and images are obtained of the cerebral blood vessels. Images that detect blood flow, called CT perfusion (CTP), may be obtained at the same time. The combination of CT, CTA and CTP can help physicians decide on the best therapy for a patient experiencing a stroke.
					</li>
					<li>
						MRI of the head: MRI uses a powerful magnetic field, radio frequency pulses and a computer to produce detailed pictures of organs, soft tissues, bone and virtually all other internal body structures. MR is also used to image the cerebral vessels, a procedure called MR angiography (MRA). Images of blood flow are produced with a procedure called MR perfusion (MRP). Physicians use MRI of the head to assess brain damage from a stroke.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="ml-3">
					To help determine the type, location, and cause of a stroke and to rule out other disorders, physicians may use:
				</p>
				
				<ul class="ml-2">
					<li>
						Blood tests.
					</li>
					<li>
						Electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG): An electrocardiogram, which checks the hearts’ electrical activity, can help determine whether heart problems caused the stroke.
					</li>
					<li>
						Carotid ultrasound/Doppler ultrasound: Ultrasound imaging involves exposing part of the body to high-frequency sound waves to produce pictures of the inside of the body. Physicians use a special ultrasound technique called Doppler ultrasound to check for narrowing and blockages in the body's two carotid arteries, which are located on each side of the neck and carry blood from the heart to the brain. Doppler ultrasound produces detailed pictures of these blood vessels and information on blood flow.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cerebral angiography. Angiography is a medical test that is performed with one of three imaging technologies—x-rays, CT or MRI, and in some cases a contrast material, to produce pictures of major blood vessels in the brain. Cerebral angiography helps physicians detect or confirm abnormalities such as a blood clot or narrowing of the arteries.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<p>
					<b><u>CT SCAN/ CAT SCAN</u></b>
					</br>
					Computed tomography (CT) is a type of imaging. It uses special x-ray equipment to make cross-sectional pictures of your body.
				
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Doctors use CT scans to look for :
				</p>
				
				<ul class="ml-2">
					<li>
						Broken bones
					</li>
					<li>
						Cancers
					</li>
					<li>
						Blood clots
					</li>
					<li>
						Signs of heart disease
					</li>
					<li>
						Internal bleeding
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="ml-2">
					During a CT scan, you lie still on a table. The table slowly passes through the center of a large X-ray machine. The test is painless. During some tests you receive a contrast dye, which makes parts of your body show up better in the image.

					<b>What is CT Scanning of the Head?</b>
				</p>
				
				<ul class="ml-2">
					<li>
						Computed tomography, more commonly known as a CT or CAT scan, is a diagnostic medical test that, like traditional x-rays, produces multiple images or pictures of the inside of the body.
					</li>
					<li>
						The cross-sectional images generated during a CT scan can be reformatted in multiple planes, and can even generate three-dimensional images. These images can be viewed on a computer monitor, printed on film or transferred to a CD or DVD.
					</li>
					<li>
						CT images of internal organs, bones, soft tissue and blood vessels provide greater detail than traditional x-rays, particularly of soft tissues and blood vessels.
					</li>
					<li>
						CT scanning provides more detailed information on head injuries, stroke, brain tumors and other brain diseases than regular radiographs (x-rays).
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					<b>What are some common uses of the procedure?</b>
				</p>
				<p class="mb-1">
					CT scanning of the head is typically used to detect:
				</p>
				
				<ul class="ml-2">
					<li>
						Bleeding, brain injury and skull fractures in patients with head injuries.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bleeding caused by a ruptured or leaking aneurysm in a patient with a sudden severe headache.
					</li>
					<li>
						A blood clot or bleeding within the brain shortly after a patient exhibits symptoms of a stroke.
					</li>
					<li>
						A stroke, especially with a new technique called Perfusion CT.
					</li>
					<li>
						Brain tumors.
					</li>
					<li>
						Enlarged brain cavities (ventricles) in patients with hydrocephalus.
					</li>
					<li>
						Diseases or malformations of the skull.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mb-1">
					CT scanning is also performed to:
				</p>
				
				<ul class="ml-2">
					<li>
						Evaluate the extent of bone and soft tissue damage in patients with facial trauma, and planning surgical reconstruction.
					</li>
					<li>
						Diagnose diseases of the temporal bone on the side of the skull, which may be causing hearing problems.
					</li>
					<li>
						Determine whether inflammation or other changes are present in the paranasal sinuses.
					</li>
					<li>
						Plan radiation therapy for cancer of the brain or other tissues.
					</li>
					<li>
						Guide the passage of a needle used to obtain a tissue sample (biopsy) from the brain.
					</li>
					<li>
						Assess aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations through a technique called CT angiography. For more information, see the CT Angiography page
					</li>	
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					<b>How should I prepare?</b>
				</p>
				
				<p class="ml-3">
					Patient should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing , usually a gown is provided  to wear during the procedure. Metal objects, including jewelry, eyeglasses, dentures and hairpins, may affect the CT images and should be left at home or removed prior to examination. 
					</br>
					Hearing aids and removable dental works will also be asked to removed, If contrast material will be used, patient will be asked not to eat or drink anything for a few hours beforehand.
					</br> 
					Inform physician of all medications being taken and if the patient have a known allergy particularly to dyes. The  doctor may prescribe medications (usually a steroid) to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction. These medications generally need to be taken 12 hours prior to administration of contrast material. 
					</br> 
					Also inform doctor of any recent illnesses or other medical conditions and whether you have a history of heart disease, asthma, diabetes, kidney disease or thyroid problems. Any of these conditions may increase the risk of an unusual adverse effect. The radiologist also should know if you have asthma, multiple myeloma or any disorder of the heart, kidneys or thyroid gland, or if you have diabetes—particularly if you are taking Glucophage.
					</br> 
					Women should always inform their physician and the CT technologist if there is any possibility that they may be pregnant. See the Safety page for more information about pregnancy and x-rays.
